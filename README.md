- I found this article interesting because it allowed me to view the advantages of Unicode through a historical lens, deepening my appreciation for the efforts aimed at creating standardization in software development. As we learned in class, this is important if we want to avoid routine swe challenges, icluding delays and unnecessary fiscal & quality-related costs.

### Luis Cordova's (LGCX) Comment:
- I also found the article to be interesting, in particular the fact that there are actually several "unique" characters for any given symbol due to the size, case, and font being used.  I feel that I severely underestimated the actual difficulty of developing unicode,  having the false notion that it was as simple as using some 8 bit code corresponding to each character.
